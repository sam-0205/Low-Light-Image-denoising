# Low-Light-Image-denoising
Low-Light-Image-Denoising is a project focused on improving the quality of images captured in low-light conditions, changing normal images to grayscale images and changing extensions of images. The project employs various image processing and deep learning techniques to reduce noise and enhance the visibility of images taken in challenging lighting situations.

## Introduction
Low-light environments often result in images with high noise levels and poor visibility. This project aims to tackle this issue by providing an automated solution for denoising and enhancing low-light images using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Noise Reduction**: Reduces noise in low-light images to improve clarity.
- **Image Enhancement**: Enhances the visibility and quality of images captured in poor lighting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use interface for processing images.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows customization of denoising and enhancement parameters.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Tensorflow**
- **Keras**
- **Flask**
- **Numpy**

### Steps
1. **Download or Clone the repository** :
```
git clone https://github.com/sam-0205/Low-Light-Image-denoising.git
```
2. **Run main.py code** :
- Once the code is ruuned a link is generarted which direct you to the required port as `  http://127.0.0.1:5001  ` .

3. **Image Storing** :
- Here the uploaded image is stored in `uploads` folder.
- After the operations are performed th enhanced images are stored in `static` folder. 


## Other Requrements
